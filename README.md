A high-performance, lightweight compression tool designed to make file storage and transfer more efficient. MyCompressionAlgorithm implemented by HuffmanAlgorithm in Rust.

## 🎉 Features

- **High Compression Ratios**: Achieve excellent file size reduction without sacrificing data integrity.
- **Algorithms**: Huffman Tree.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface and configuration options for easy integration into your workflow.
- **Fast & Efficient**: Optimized for performance, making compression and decompression lightning fast.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system if building from source.

### Installation

To install Compress Tool, simply clone the repository and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BriceLucifer/CompressAlgorithm.git
cd CompressAlgorithm
cargo build --release
```

Alternatively, you can download pre-built binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/BriceLucifer/CompressAlgorithm/releases).

### Usage
```bash
cargo run
```

#### Basic Compression

```bash
unimplemented
```

#### Basic Decompression

```bash
unimplemented
```

#### Advanced Options

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Algorithm | Compression Ratio | Compression Speed (MB/s) | Decompression Speed (MB/s) |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Huffman   | 63.52%            |        1.86 MB/s         |        4.88 MB/s           |


> **Note**: Performance may vary based on your system specifications.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

- **src/** - Main source files for the compression tool
- **tests/** - Test cases for ensuring code quality and functionality
- **examples/** - Usage examples and scripts
    > I use [enwik8](https://mattmahoney.net/dc/enwik8.zip) as performence test, but i store a simple page for example, because I don't have too much storage.
